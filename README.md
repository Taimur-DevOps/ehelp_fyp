# PROJECT
Ehelp is a cloud-based platform that allows to help people to fulfill their needs or the needs of the requester. Here requester can generate a call for help by posting it on ehelp's public newsfeed platform, ehelp will forward that request to other users, one who is able to fullfill this request will accept it and after satisfaction help will be provided.

The user who helps will be potraid as a hero the more he helps more points will be added and hero will be ranked in top 100 in city, country and worldwide, by trusting others organizations for helping others don't waste your money, find the needy here, help them by yourself and achieve a social status in community.
 
# MAIN IDEA
* Request for help
* Request anonymously so no one can see except your hero
* Requests will not affect your achievements points or levels
* Help others to achieve points, tiers and ranks
* Go higher ranks by achieving higher points
* Achieve different tags
* Share your success stories with other so they help others to
* Share your achievements points, level and tiers on different social platform like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter etc
